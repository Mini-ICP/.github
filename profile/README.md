## Project Overview

Mini-ICP is designed to revolutionize the web3 gaming experience by bringing discoverability, seamless onboarding, and innovative betting mechanisms to gamers, especially in India. This platform aims to serve as a one-stop-shop for discovering, playing, and betting on games built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), addressing the pain points faced by gamers in transitioning from web2 to web3.

## **Challenges We Address**

### 1. Discoverability
Many gamers face challenges when trying to find web3 games due to a lack of centralized platforms. Mini-ICP solves this by curating and showcasing games built on ICP, making it easy for players to explore and engage with various titles.

### 2. Onboarding & Customizability
Web3 onboarding can be complex and deterring. Mini-ICP simplifies this process by providing customized call-to-action (CTA) buttons tailored for each game, ensuring players can quickly engage. For instance, a CTA like "Claim your 1st pack now" for a trading card game allows players to mint a card pack and start playing with minimal friction.

### 3. Betting & Prediction Markets
Gamers enjoy speculative activities such as betting on tournaments. Mini-ICP introduces a web3-native feature enabling users to bet on gaming tournament outcomes. Players can deposit USDC into a pool and place bets on participants, with winners sharing the pool pro rata after the event concludes. This brings an engaging layer of interaction that taps into existing gaming behaviors.
